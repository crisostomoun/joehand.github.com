There are so many different areas of the industry that it is possible to think disruptively about. I
could think about the books as a container, the libraries as a place, the publishers as an entity,
the readers as a group, the writers as artists. There are so many different facets of the industry
and consumers at so many different levels of it. How do you get your head around the whole thing in
order to think disruptively about it.

Or, maybe that is the point, to consider what isn't being done or has not been tried. Think about
inverting the whole thing or just certain paths. Disruptive thinking can be large or small it just
has to be different. The smallest change can be large enough to destroy an entire industry while a
large shift can be slow and deliberate, but the case can be made for the opposite.

So lets dig in and start to think about it.

##Disrupting the libraries

__What if library consumers checked books into the library?__

__What if a book could only be checked out once a certain number of people wanted to?__

__What if libraries sold books to the publishers?__

It is pretty difficult to understand where the line between feasible and absurd stands at this
point. So much can change that anything is really possible in this industry. I guess that amplifies
the power of disruptive thinking even more. With everything set the change we never know what will
remain the same. Things that we believe to be constant will be shifting.

So I think my thinking may be even too narrow. Perhaps I need to focus on the overarching goal of
all of these interconnected industries. This vast terrain starts with writers, professors, and
weaves in and out of hundreds of people from publishers to artists, librarians to stock boys, book
stores to delivery companies, and finally it reaches the reader. But there is no set path. Every bit
of information can take a different path from author to consumer.

What is the real focus here? How connected are these two parties and how connected should they be?
One can assume that authors and consumers of the written word and most information consumers are
also writers. Man this is confusing.

Then comes the question of information. How does the information contained in words differ from that
of images, videos, or sounds? Should we even attempt to separate out these elements, what would be
the point if they all reach towards the same goal?
