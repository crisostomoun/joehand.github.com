## Staying Fit

I play some sports, bike everywhere I go, and do other generally athletic activities.

On any given day you may find me:

* Playing Ultimate Frisbee
* Biking
* Doing Crossfit
* Walking in my Vibram FiveFingers
* Skiing
* Doing yoga or pilates
* ... And lots more

## The Weakest Link

My senior year at Reed College I captained the Ultimate Frisbee team. Going into the college sectionals tournament I was in the best shape of my life. The day before I had received a nice knee to the calf. No big deal. Outside of a tight calf, I warmed up for our first game with no worries.

Not too far into our third game I accelerated for a cut up the line, perhaps my favorite cut, me and any other handler. But someone else had already gotten open in the end zone. Score for Reed.

During the cut my defender kicked my heel, or so I thought. He denied it when I questioned him. But I had heard it AND felt it. The instant after asking him the jolt of pain came.

I knew it was bad. A haze of pain, people helping me to the sidelines, and the trainer's questions clogged my brain. Collapsed on the sideline, I reached down and felt my ankle. Something was missing. A void filled the space previously occupied by the thickest and strongest tendon in my body, a torn Achilles. My last game as a Reed Berserker ended with me crumpled on the sideline, crying and helpless.

If I had to choose the one most defining moment in my life, it would be my birth. But this would take a close second. Surgery three days later began a long road to recovery.

More than two years later recovery continues. I can run, jump, and bike. I ski, hike, and continue to push myself to new physical limits. But I do all of that knowing that part of me is sewn together like two paintbrushes. And it will never be the same. My Achilles heel is now my Achilles' heel.

Thankfully my professor had the kindness to help me see the bright side of it all.
