This design is a complete rip-off of the design of the [Svbtle](http://svbtle.com) blogging platform. Interestingly, I am not the first person to do this. Right after the initial release someone was not happy that Svbtle was invite only, so they created [Obtvse](https://github.com/NateW/obtvse) - an open source version of Svbtle. 

The result was a very [interesting discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3744237) about the ethics behind stealing a design and idea. 

###Why did I 'steal' the design?

Basically, I thought it was a great design. I wanted to spend some time recreating it and learning in the process. Rather than copy the design exactly, I expanded on it a little. 

When I first looked at a couple blogs running Svbtle I was on my iPad. Unfortunately, Svbtle does a really bad job if the iPad is vertical. I wanted to improve the responsiveness while keeping the essence of the original design. 

I love the minimalism of the original design which made it a great starting point. So, thank you Dustin Curtis. I hope to continue to refine it to my liking.
