Creating a habit in a tricky thing. At first it seems so simple. You wake up and floss your teeth. Boom, done. Next day - you almost forget but then remember, teeth flossed. Then the third day you may forget or put it off until the day it done. And eventually you keep putting it off and it does not get done. 

Starting a new habit is not something you can just jump into. You must slowly approach it so as to not scare it off. Then you need to coddle it, never let it leave your side for a month. After a month it starts to grow. But it can still escape if you are not careful. Every week you must reconnect with it. Remind yourself why you are building this habit and what you hope to achieve. After a couple months your habit may finally blossom. 

There is a science to habits, literally. There are millions or even billions of dollars in creatings habits. Companies try to get you in the habit of buying their product. Grocery stores get you in the habit of buying a treat, just this one time, in the checkout line. If you approach habits with the same careful scientific mindset, you can get in the habit of creating habits.
