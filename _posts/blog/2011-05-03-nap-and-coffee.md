I feel like the biggest driving issue with digital books is the container. Once the container gets
standardized, the content and usage can become more standardized. So I guess the question is how to
you become the standard container for a type of information. I would imagine the book had some sort
of competition, people who bound the pages in a different way or presented ideas differently, right?
It does not really sound right.

I wonder if we are too stuck on the idea of a "book". Does a remix machine need even to have that
idea. There is definitely some idea of cognitive location within an argument. Without knowing how
long the argument lasts it may be difficult to focus or understand what the writer is saying. But
how can we say that when have books that range from 50 pages to thousands. We have messages that are
limited to 140 characters and messages that are unlimited.

When information first started to be communicated over wires a new neo-language had to be invented
to convey the message. Then in order to protect privacy and save money people went further to create
secret languages on top of this neo-language. That is a pretty powerful idea.

Just by having this standard means of communication people were able to be so innovative around it.
Was it the standardization or the uniqueness or what? It seems like the morse-code telegraph broke
so many boundaries it had to be a hot bed ripe for innovation. So how do you create that kind of
atmosphere around a product.

Does it tell a story? Or connect people? Or just provide economic advantage?

Maybe our thinking is indeed too narrow. Is the portal or the container more important. I think of
Google as a portal. iTunes is more of a container. Both are powerful market movers.

Google has used the portal to become a container for other types of goods. What gave them an
advantage here?
