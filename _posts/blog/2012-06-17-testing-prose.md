This blog post was created and published using [Prose.io](http://prose.io). Setting up Prose took seconds. Prose connects with your GitHub account. Once you authorize it, Prose uses the GitHub API to act as a content managament system for your repositories. Though you can browse and edit any file, Prose is built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

##Jekyll & Prose - A Match Made in Heaven

Luckily, my blog setup was perfect for using Prose. I started using Jekyll and [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) awhile ago. Currently, the blog using [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) with a custom made theme (inspiried by [Svtble](https://svbtle.com/). 

Before my publishing workflow was not as seamless as I wanted it to be. Prose simplifies the workflow. You can use it as a place to create and edit drafts. When you are ready, one check and they are published.

Prose also gives you the handy markdown cheatsheet and preview. Both things I was using constantly while writing posts. 

##Setting Up Your Blog to use Prose

**Already have a Jekyll blog that uses GitHub Pages?** Nice! Just authorize Prose.io to use your GitHub account and you are set. Create a new post, save, mark it as published when you are ready.

**Don't have a Jekyll blog yet?** Go ahead and fork this one, check out Jekyll Boostrap, or choose one of the many already on GitHub. Once you have your own repository, just head to Prose.io and browse your new blog! Boom.


Looking forward to more of Prose in the future.
