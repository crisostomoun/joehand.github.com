{% include JB/setup %}

This blog post was posted using [prose.io](http://prose.io). It is a content management system that uses GitHub and Jekyll. This means I can keep using the blog setup I already made and use prose as a place to draft and publish my posts. Pretty sweet.

Prose.io acts as a visual browser for your GitHub repositories. You can then edit Markdown files directly in the browser. Posts can be saved as drafts or published. 

Look forward to more of this in the future.
