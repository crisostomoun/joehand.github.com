{% include JB/setup %}

This blog post was posted using [prose.io](http://prose.io). It is a recently created content management system that uses GitHub and jekyll. This means I could keep using the blog setup I already made and use prose as a place to draft and publish my posts. Pretty sweet.

Look forward to more of this in the future.
