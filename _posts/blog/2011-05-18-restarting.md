Today was a good morning so far yet I still feel distracted. It is pretty hard to jump into writing
without even thinking about the topic before hand. I need to devise a more complete system for me to
complete blog posts.

So far it goes something like this: 

* write random pretty shitty post that goes nowhere
* stop

It should probably go more like this: 

* Think about what I want to write about 
* Form the three main
acts
* Do a little research, gather relevant information
* Write Post
* Edit
* Make pretty
* Post

Seven steps for success!

The next question is whether it is worth it to rebuild the old posts I have or if I should start
fresh. Some of the posts were just rambles while others were more specific. Through editing I will
be able to trim those down to a specific idea. It seems like the whole writing process still
mystifies me.

But, of course, practice makes perfect. Lots and lots of practice.

Anyways, back to this morning, here is how it went down: -woke up at 6am sharp, hop out of bed,
introduce eyes to bright light (via opening of curtains) -clothe -Usual lights/heat/water routine -Some dishes while waiting for water to warm -Black 
tea and some orange to start the day -Read books! -Finished tea around 7 and started coffee process
-Drank one cup of coffee while reading more books -Pilates/Yoga and daily show -Shower/Shave -Dress
-Breakfast and second cup of coffee -Sit down at my computer and start punching keys with my fingers
to represent my ideas on the screen as information.

Information is really fascinating. It is everywhere yet nowhere. We cannot get enough yet we always
have too much. How exactly does our relationship with information work? Has this relationship
changed as our information consumption habits change?

This morning I was wondering whether I could call myself a "digital librarian" or something along
those lines. In the professional sense a librarian usually needs to have the appropriate degree. But
there are specialists that call themselves types of librarians without having the degrees.

Maybe I want to become a librarian. What a perfect job for me right? Unfortunately, I really do not
know what they do. Add that to the fact that what they do will totally change in the next 10 years.
Perhaps, I can shape the job to what I want it to become then take it for myself.

What do I envision as the perfect librarian job for me?

I mean really how far away would it be from what I do now. I am creating books, curating content,
and creating discovery tools for students. I work to understand how people view, process, and gather
information. I am fascinated by books, information, collections of things, and anything that binds
together many ideas into one consumable unit.

Is it more important to ask the questions or does the real exercise come in trying to find the
answers?

Asking the right questions is hard. Finding the answers has to be even harder, especially when there
is no answer. How can you motivate yourself to some goal knowing that goal will never appear. And is
that even worthwhile? I feel like I have way too many questions and not near enough answers.

Maybe the fact that there is no answer is the real answer. We can work to create the answer where no
one else is willing to work. That is all a disruptive innovation is. A place where everyone knows
there is a problem and one person or group provides a different answer than what everyone thought it
was. But no, aren't we trying to reframe the question. Or are the old companies just asking the
wrong question.
