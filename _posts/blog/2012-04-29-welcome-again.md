I finally created/[stole](/thoughts/2012/04/stealing-great-art) a blog design I am happy with. With the new design I hope to start writing more publicly. I already write a lot, at least [750 words](http://750words.com) a day, but most of it remains private. Without any public accountability my writing quality suffers.

So, here is to a fresh start... again.
