This morning was rudely awakened by an opinion piece in the WSJ drawing a comparison between public
school and "public grocery stores". The article made me angry. The author begins with the assumption
that anything free market is inherently better than anything publicly provided by government.
Without getting into the details of this assumption, and probably derailing his argument in the
process, the author proceeds to illustrate the idea of a public grocery store. Of course, in his
illustration the public grocery store fails miserably.

Sorry I got too angry to continue writing. And now i must head to work.
