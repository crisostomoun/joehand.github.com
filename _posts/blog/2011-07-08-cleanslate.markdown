Washing away the old and preparing for the new. Before on this page there were a couple blog posts, but nothing worth talking about. Seth Godin [posted today](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/put-your-name-on-it-1.html) about _putting your name on it_:

The things I wrote before were not worth signing. This decreased my motivation to write new posts. So here is to starting fresh--creating something where I will proudly display my seal of approval.

##Riding the wave.
This fresh start comes on the wave of another new project. Two weeks ago I began a project at [smilingjoe.com](http://smilingjoe.com) called __Experiments in Kindness__. I feel a strange force pulling me forwards. Bringing me towards new opportunities, encouraging me to explore new ways of thinking. It is exciting yet scary. I only hope I can stay above the surf. 

But getting knocked down may be a better experience than riding the wave itself. So then I look forwards to whatever lies ahead.
