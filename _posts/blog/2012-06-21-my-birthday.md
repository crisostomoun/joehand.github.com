Today marks a quarter century since I was born. It also marks the first day of summer, though this year was one of the rare years the my birthday and the solstice did not coincide. 

I joined some friends for a beautiful picnic last night in Portland's Rose Garden. Great friends, great food, nice weather, flowers, and some good wine. Not much more you need for a good birthday celebration.

I have thought a lot about living a long life. I hope this quarter century marks the first of six in my life. 150 seems like a long life. But I will be sure to enjoy every day of it. 

Happy first day of summer!

=)
