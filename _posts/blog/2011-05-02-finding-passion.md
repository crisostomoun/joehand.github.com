Both Ken Robinson and Seth Godin preach similar sentiments. Each encourages us to start doing
something we love and share that gift with others. By doing something we love we become more
energized by doing that thing. That allows us to share even more with the world. At the same time,
when we do something we love, the opportunities change in our lives. By living through our passion
we can reshape our lives to become something better.

'Be the change you want to see in the world' -Ghandi

Just like an angry person cannot bring world peace, you must follow your passion to live a
fulfilling life. The difficulty comes in finding what that passion is.

Where have I found myself to be passionate? When have I done something where I lose all track of
time? What activities give me energy?

These are all very interesting questions that are difficult to answer. I can think back about what I
have done in the past that fueled me, but what if that has changed. I can think about what I am
excited about in the future, but is that enough to drive my life forwards.

I am passionate about happiness in a way that others do not seem to be. I am passionate about being
myself, caring, kindness. I strive to be the best person I can be, and I enjoy spending time
understanding how I can do that.

I love new ideas. I love seeing new ideas change others even more. But how can that help me find my
tribe?

Maybe I should have been an engineer or architect. What if that is what I was meant to do? How would
my life path look different had I pursued that passion?

I want to write more today. Yesterday I proposed a post about the overarching goal of Seamless.
Perhaps that is too grand of a topic. I am distracted. The resistance is pulling me away. Should I
give in? Should I keep writing?

Maybe my passion is just as the quote from Ghandi above. Perhaps I can find my passion by being the
change I want to see in the world.
