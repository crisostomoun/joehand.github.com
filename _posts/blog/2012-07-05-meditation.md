The only way to achieve something is to keep trying until you succeed. Put another way, you must practice failing first to find success later. With each failure you may learn something. Without learning how to execute, nothing can be accomplished. Meditation is the practice of failure.

The meditation program on [Budge](http://bud.ge/) brought this to my attention today. Before the first challenge Budge warns you that meditation is not easy and that you will fail. 

What is Budge? It is a great habit building tool. I started with first with flossing and pushups. While my pushup habit wavered it helped to get me in the habit of flossing. I now floss daily without even thinking about it, habitually you could say. 

Budge programs mistones for you to hit. As you get better at the habit, the milestones get harder. For flossing, it was simple. Step 1, buy floss. Step 2, floss a tooth. On it went until I was flossing all my teeth for 7 days.

I started the meditation program today. And I failed in meditation today. Many times. Luckily, I still get to put the big red X on my calendar. Because just committing myself to try for 5 minutes each day is all that counts.

I look forward to my continued failure.
