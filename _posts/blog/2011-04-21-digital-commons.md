A public commons.

There are specific commons for each interest group. People can join a common that they support and
donate money to that. In return, they receive all the material shared within that group. All public
educational institutions share a library. There can be smaller research groups inside each larger
group.

Within a commons group- material can be exchanged freely. Outsiders can purchase the material.

Each commons group can have different requirements. For example, the group of public libraries would
be restricted to people who were actually public libraries. Other groups could require a
subscription and/or one time payment.

This could extend from a public collection free for everyone to a subscription group for a single
author.

All of the commons groups are not-for-profit. This allows all subscriptions to be considered
recurring donations. In the case of a single book purchase, a one time donation can be paid.

You have eternal access whenever you "buy" something. If you are subscribed to a group, you can only
see material so long as you pay. Of course, all notes/etc will be saved if you choose to
resubscribe.

Within each commons group, authors are paid a certain percentage determined by number of views.
Subscriptions also go towards the purchasing of new material to add to the commons.

need graphs showing where the money is going.

you can donate more to your local library or commons in order to see the selection expand, i.e.
donations stay local to each commons.

Note: some portion of either the subscriptions or donations would go towards the operating costs
for the entire engine.


notes from __a global education challenge__: "mutual alignment of education, business and economic
growth, ... surprising that the education and corporate philanthropy communities frequently operate
on separate, parallel tracks and speak different languages, even though they share similar social
goals."

companies tend to invest in small amounts and do so very strategically. more support may be found
with increased localization and donations by sector. businesses have interest in creating more value
through their philanthropy.
