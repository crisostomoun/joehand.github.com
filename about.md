I am a 24 year old living in Portland, Oregon. I manage projects at [Periscopic](http://periscopic.com), a socially-conscious data visualization company. I have a very curious mind and am intrigued by many things. My thoughts revolve around information & data visualization, urban planning/transportation, economics, and morality.

In 2009, I graduated with a bachelors from Reed College. While at Reed I studied mathematics and economics. In my thesis I studied a macroeconomic model using creative destruction as its growth mechanism. I am still very much interested in this idea of creative destruction and the implications it has today.

I get around mostly with my bike. It is a stable steed built by Kona. Like me, it is simple yet efficient; with only one fixed gear it gets the job done. Every day I enjoy my ride to work, rain or shine. But lets face it, the ride is especially nice when it is shine.

Born and raised near Denver, Colorado, I always find myself attracted towards the outdoors and mountains. During the Winter I ski. Summers you can find me playing Ultimate, backpacking or hiking, and generally enjoying the sunshine.

That moment when you really understand how or why something works brings me the most satisfaction of anything. I also like to make cookies - the chewy, warm, delicious chocolate chip kind.

You can find me other places on the web:
